# PRODIGY_ML_04 - Hand Gesture Recognition with CNN

This project is part of the **Machine Learning Internship** offered by **Prodigy InfoTech**.

---

## 📊 Task Objective
Develop a **Hand Gesture Recognition Model** using the **LeapGestRecog Dataset** that can classify different hand gestures from images.

---

## 📌 Dataset Source
- [LeapGestRecog Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog)

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 🐍  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab  

---

## 📈 Approach
- Downloaded and preprocessed the dataset  
- Applied **pseudo-coloring** to grayscale gesture images  
- Built and trained a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
- Evaluated the model on test data  
- Visualized predictions and model performance
